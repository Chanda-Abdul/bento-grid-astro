## Overview

### The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this bento grid and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:
- [ ] View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
<!-- To-do GSAP Animations -->
**Expected behavior:** 
- [ ] The two components in the left column on desktop are placed at the bottom on mobile. This is a good opportunity to practice your CSS Grid placement skills.
